# Pigle
A passive BTLE based scanner which detects and outputs device information when anything produced by Axon International (Formerly Taser International) is within Bluetooth range. The script is incredibly simple and uses mostly code from the Bleak documentation. The tool is incredibly basic right now, so I hope to expand it in the future.
